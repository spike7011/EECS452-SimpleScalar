sim-safe: This simulator implements a functional simulator.  This
functional simulator is the simplest, most user-friendly simulator in the
simplescalar tool set.  Unlike sim-fast, this functional simulator checks
for all instruction errors, and the implementation is crafted for clarity
rather than speed.
